happy valentines day, my love.

i dont rlly know what to say than I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH. meeting you was the best "accident" i've ever had. i never thought id find the love of my life. i thought i never would, until i got to know you.

i still remember the day when you confessed to me. i couldnt be much happier than that. it was the best thing that ever happened to me. i still remember how cold and shaky my hands were when i read your books. my face felt so warm, i couldnt stop smiling from ear to ear. i was a bit unsure what to answer, but something in my heart told me that this was right, that YOU, are the one ive been looking for. im fuckass glad  i followed my heart.

each days, weeks, and months passed by, and ive been falling more and more in love with you. i love spending time with you even if its js texting each other, i love playing roblox and building things on minecraft with you, i love how we keep calling all the time even though i barely spoke (im so sorry) but somehow i could feel your presence, like you were really here by myside. 

i feel so loved by you. i feel like the luckiest ever for having you. you helped me through my hard times.. and uh.. soft times(?) too.. and so did i. sweetheart, you may think that you are not enough, that you keep making mistakes, and other stuff. but you aren't my love. you're more than enough for me. and also, even though you said you were a bad person in the past but its all in the past. i admire how you had the courage to change, to try leaving whats in the past. not many can do that but you did it. im really proud of you. i hope you can really be better mentally too. i'll be always there no matter what. i love you for who you are.

i hope our relationship will stay strong as long as possible. we're in this together, my love. i know im not alone. and you aren't too. i love whenever we had an argument, we ended up sayin sorry for each other and admit our wrongs. you are really a mature person, i learned alot from you despite being older than you (fuck you).

i love you, i always will.

yours trully,
Ra
